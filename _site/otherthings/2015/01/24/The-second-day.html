  <article class="post-content">
    <p>Today is the second day of my vacation and I am still building my blog site. The basic functions of a blog have been implemented, and I have made a simple homepage.</p>

<p>Building a blog(or any other web site) of oneself is really a good way to learn html and css, compared with learning from reading some book from cover to cover, it is much easier to focus on, and we can learn much faster. I’ve heard a kind of opinion that <em>western stutents tend to learn something in practice, while Chinese students prefer learning systematically</em>, to a large extent, I agree with this opinion, and I believe in many cases, the former way of learning is of big advantage.</p>

<p><strong>I find GitHub of great help</strong> when I trying to build my site, in GigHub I can find a lot of source code of good blog examples. That’s really great! I believe that I should spend more time in GitHub, and try to use it better. The source code in github is very good materials for learning programming.</p>

<p>And <strong>to design a webside</strong> is really a <strong>difficult job</strong>, even choosing a color will take tons of time. At the end I decide make my homepage nearly the same as a example in jekyll’s wiki. And I will change my sites’ appearence a lot in the future using some javascript.</p>

<p>What’s more, write blog in English is not a easy job for, I spent a nearly an hour writing these words…I think I may use Chinese in the future, so that a lot of time can be saved.</p>

<p><strong>More efficiency, more concentrated, go go go!</strong></p>
