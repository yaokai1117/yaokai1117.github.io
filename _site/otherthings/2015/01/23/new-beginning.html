<p>I am now building my own blog in GitHub Pages using jekyll, it is my first time to write a web page myself, and I think it will be a good chance for me to learn css, javascript, and some ruby maybe.</p>

<p>Today is also the first day of my winter vacation, I’ve got a ‘big’ plan. I’d like to complete at least two courses(one about algorim, and one about data-science) in coursera, and learn some skill in web designing, I also want to finish reading the book Computer System:A Programmer’s Perspective during this vacaion. It seems not very easy to complete those tasks all, but I’d like to have a try. At the end of this vacation, I will write something about whether I have finished them, and I will post it here as a summary. Obviously, to avoid being shamed at that time, I need to work hard from now on.</p>

<p>After one and a half years of studying in USTC, I find it become even harder for me to write something like a blog post. That’s one of the reasons why I decide to bulid up my blog. I think often writing something is a very good habbit, I hope I can make it last.</p>
